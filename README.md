Adversarial Robustness vs Model Compression, or Both?
-----------------------

In this work,  This paper first proposes a framework of concurrent adversarial training and different weight pruning that enables model compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and essentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training.

Prerequisites
-----------------------

code is compatible with pytorch 1.0.0



Train a model in natural setting/adversarial setting
-----------------------


main.py or adv_main.py for main program, natural setting and adversarial setting respectively

eval.py for quick checking of the sparsity and do some other stuff

config.yaml.example template of the configuration file. One for each dataset.

run.sh.example  template script for running the code.





Compression in adversarial setting are only supported for MNIST and CIFAR10. 

Only compression in natural setting is supported in ImageNet.
